# 🔑 AdonisJS App Key Generator for cPanel

This script allows you to generate an AdonisJS app key on cPanel without SSH access.

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Method 1: Using npm script (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run generate:key
```

### **Method 2: Direct execution**
```bash
node generate-key.js
```

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

1. **Node.js installed** on your cPanel hosting
2. **Project files uploaded** to your cPanel hosting
3. **Dependencies installed** (`npm install` completed)

## 🔧 **cPanel Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Upload Files**
1. Upload your project files to cPanel
2. Make sure `ace` file is in the project root
3. Upload `generate-key.js` and `package.json`

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **Step 3: Generate App Key**
```bash
npm run generate:key
```

## 🎯 **What the Script Does**

1. **Checks environment** - Verifies you're in the right directory
2. **Runs AdonisJS command** - Executes `node ace generate:key`
3. **Updates .env file** - Automatically updates your environment file
4. **Shows results** - Displays the generated key and confirmation

## 📁 **Files Created/Modified**

- **`.env`** - Updated with new `APP_KEY`
- **`generate-key.js`** - Temporary script (delete after use)

## 🚨 **Security Notes**

1. **Delete the script** after generating your key
2. **Never commit** the generated key to version control
3. **Keep .env file** secure and not publicly accessible
4. **Regenerate key** if you suspect it's been compromised

## ❌ **Troubleshooting**

### **"ace file not found" Error**
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Verify the `ace` file was uploaded correctly

### **Permission Denied Error**
- Check file permissions (should be 644 for files, 755 for directories)
- Ensure Node.js has execute permissions

### **Node.js Not Found Error**
- Use cPanel's Node.js Selector to set up Node.js
- Make sure the correct Node.js version is selected

## 🎉 **Success Message**

When successful, you'll see:
```

```

## 🗑️ **Cleanup**

1. **Delete `generate-key.js`** - No longer needed
2. **Verify .env file** - Contains your new APP_KEY
3. **Test your application** - Make sure it starts correctly
